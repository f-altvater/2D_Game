# 2D_Game

I began to build this file to practice more JavaScript and to get more in touch with basic user inputs.
The best approach to this for me was to just start and build a basic 2D webgame.

I learned some behaviours of Objects again, how to use the constructor method and super method for extending Subclasses. My goal was to achieve all of this
with just vanilla JS.

You play an upgradeable ship with four upgradeable objects.
You clear waves of enemies, every 5th wave a Boss spawns at the end of a wave.
Difficulties change damage dealt to you, gold collected from you and how much gold yuou collect from enemies, aswell as how much healing you get in between waves.
