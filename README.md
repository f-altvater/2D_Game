# 2D_Game

I began to build this file to practice more JavaScript and to get more in touch with basic user inputs.
The best approach to this for me was to just start and build a basic 2D webgame.

I learned some behaviours of Objects again, how to use the constructor method and super method for extending Subclasses. My goal was to achieve all of this
with just vanilla JS.

In the whatShouldItDo.txt file I listed the things I weanted to implement and I gave myself a bit of a structure on how to build the script.js file with it.
